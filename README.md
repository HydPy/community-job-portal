An open source job portal for the communities and by the communties.

## About Community Job Portal

Community Job Portal is about creating a community job platform which will be integrated with all active communities through bots on platforms like - â€œSlack, Telegram, Zulip, Discord etc. Using these bots, community members of such groups can use some predefined text format to post a job directly to the community job portal which can include a trigger for a bot to post the job. Community members would also be able to create their user profiles on this platform. Based on the posted jobs on the platform, our recommendation systems on the platform will directly notify the right person(fit) for the position who is/are looking for a change. A job aspirant can anytime come on the portal to look for the open job positions and apply for it using the given information.

To understand more about Community Job Portal, please go through with [documentation](https://github.com/HydPy/community-job-portal/wiki) on the wiki, we'll try and keep the documentation updated.
